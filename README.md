## 1. Introduction
The deluge of data combined with new technologies and analysis techniques, has the potential to inform decision and policy making in unprecedented ways. Governments increasingly generating large-scale data sets on a range of topics, including climate change, geospatial data, traffic patterns, health and disease data, purchasing behavior, and social behavior through social media interactions.
This large-scale data in the era of geographic information systems (GIS) cause new challenges: discerning how to analyze and process the geospatial big data, how the spatial big data can be clustered, distributed, stored, indexed, and managed, and how this data can be computed or visualized in the system with high performance. In this project we use spark to analyze Chicago crimes dataset.
## 2. Goals
Visualize Chicago crimes Geo data over a geographic map.
Data analysis and visualization using spark.
## 3. Data
In this project we use the Chicago crimes dataset. This data reflects reported incidents of crime (except for murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. This data contains about 7 million records with the following attributes:
